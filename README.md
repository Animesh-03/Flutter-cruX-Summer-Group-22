# Flutter cruX Summer Group 22

Welcome to the Flutter Summer Group by cruX!

> I am Animesh; Akshat and I will be your Flutter Mentors for the duration of the summer group.

Throughout this summer group you will be building a fully functional news app using <a href="https://newsapi.org/">newsapi</a>, an OTP based authentication using firebase and a bookmark system using firestore.

I will be posting material which consist of tutorials and videos on the web by well known Youtubers for flutter dev and some hand-typed explanation from me on specific topics every week.

I hope you will learn something new and useful this summer and have a good addition to your projects on GitHub.
