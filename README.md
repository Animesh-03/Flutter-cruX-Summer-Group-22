# Flutter cruX Summer Group 22
Welcome to the Flutter Summer Group by cruX!

I am Animesh and will be your Flutter Mentor for the duration of the summer group. 

By the end of this summer group you will be building a fully functional news app using <a href="https://newsapi.org/">newsapi</a>, an OTP based authentication using firebase and a bookmark system using firestore.

I will be posting material which consist of tutorials and videos on the web by well known Youtubers for flutter dev and some hand-typed explaination from me on specific topics every week.

I hope you will learn something new and useful this summer!
