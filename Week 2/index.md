# Week 2
Congratulations on making it to Week 2! Hope you had fun with the assignment last week whose aim was to get you familiar with the OOPS concepts and a bit of DSA as well which is going to be very useful not only for flutter but your IT career as well.

This week you will go deeper into making beautiful and responsive apps by adding images using the `Image` widget as well as adding multiple screens to our app and of course to be able to view the multiple screens you will be learning about Navigation and the `Navigator` widget.

## Assignment
The assignment this week will be building an entire app with multiple screens. Further details will be revealed later.
